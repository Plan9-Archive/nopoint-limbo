# intro

nopoint is a tool for displaying slideshows, inspired by magicpoint.
the user writes slides with simple commands, in plain text.  slides
can contain text, lists of text, images or tables.  these can be
styled, e.g. change the (background) colors, alignment, font style
and font size.  nopoint parses the file and displays it on the
screen.  keyboard keys and mouse clicks allow navigating through
the slides.

see the manual page nopoint(1) for more information.
see lib/nopoint/nopoint.nop for a demo.


# install

make sure you have $ROOT set, now run "mk" to compile and
"mk install" to install the files.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.

nopoint opens the Vera true type fonts, expecting them in /fonts/ttf.
you will need to copy the vera fonts to that directory before running
nopoint.  alternatively, you can edit appl/cmd/nopoint.b to open
other ttf fonts.

# todo

- find obscure bug that changes fontsize on rendered slides.  seems
  to be when navigating with (page)up/down and show() kills pre-renderers
  for no-longer-next slides.

- can we do without mainimg in render()?
- generate png's with an html page showing small versions and linking to big versions.
- influence of align,indent,fontsize and what they are relative to can use some careful thought
- should not word-break around {}'s
- find a way to flow text around images.  perhaps do it the easy
  way and allow specifying layers, and let the user do some positioning.
  that would implement backgrounds too.
- word background color wouldn't be hard...
- more styles?  eg borders
- perhaps allow multiple font sizes on one line?  needs keeping track of baseline.
- some way to output to pdf?  or perhaps latex (easier).
- mode for checking whether everything in the slides is valid?
- get rid of appl/lib/imageopen.b.  make image resizing less inefficient & ugly.
